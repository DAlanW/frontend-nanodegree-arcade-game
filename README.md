Frogger Clone by David A Wampler: GitHub user DAlanW
Originally forked from "udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game"

The objective of this "Frogger" game clone is to reach the top of the screen while avoiding contact with enemies. Using the control pad, the player must move past three rows of enemies, represented by lady-bug-like creatures, up to the row of water. If the player comes into contact with an enemy, the page will confirm the player's "death," and restart the player. If the player makes it to the top, the game will confirm success, and notify the player that the number of enemies has been increased by one.
